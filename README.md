# leading-edge

Dear visitor,

This is a collection of scripts to install the most useful leading edge software for BeatQuantum Labs - my own academic laboratory. 

Please feel free to copy, amend and use any of these scripts. I am strong supporter of open source and free software. You can give me the credit (if you wish) but even that is optional and not expected.

You are strongly advised to fully test every script in a test environment. Production environments should not experiment with the latest, leading edge, bleeding edge software. Therefore, please use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any losses, hacks, data thefts, system failures, damages, problems or sleepless nights! 

Thank you.

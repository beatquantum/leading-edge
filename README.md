# leading-edge

Dear visitor,

I am strong supporter of open source and free software. Please read LICENSE and DISCLAIMER files first.

This is a collection of scripts to install the most useful leading edge software for my own academic laboratories. The following command will be useful to copy all code.

git clone https://github.com/beatquantum/leading-edge

Thank you.
